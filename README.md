# TBFO - Javascript Syntax Checker

This programs allows you to validate your javascript file, the programs will give a verdict `accepted` or `error`. We use CYK Algorithm to check whether the syntax is correct or not. This simple syntax checker build based on CFG that we've made and then convert it into CNF. Therefore the validity in this programs only validate about the syntax, not each functionality of the programs.

## How To Run
Open your terminal in main folder and then type :
```powershell
python main.py <filename.js>
```

Make sure your file is in the same folder as main program
